2018-05-28 Verions 2.0.0 (beta)
	SSH terminal support
	Include prompt for user credentials in enterprise mode

2018-05-24 Version 1.9.0 (stable)
	resynced FreeRDP (version 2.0-RC2-dev3), now using the openssl 1.1.x architecture. Should fix any previously reported FQDN and NLA issues
	added a pdf virtual printer; any document printed with the "Myrtille PDF" printer is downloaded to the browser and can be opened/saved/printed from there

	added a client ip tracking option to prevent unauthorized accesses. configurable into web.config (thanks bigpjo)
	cookieless sessions are now disabled by default. This lowers the risk of session stealing (by simply copying the url) but also removes the ability to have multiple connections/tabs. can still be enabled into web.config, but use at your own risk! (thanks bigpjo)
	strengthened security to prevent session fixation attack or spoofing if cookieless sessions are enabled

	fixed issue with enterprise host create session including invalid /popup/ path in sessionURL. (thanks bigpjo)
	the remote session is now disconnected after the browser window/tab is closed, or connection is lost, to prevent it from being left open server side. configurable into web.config (thanks bigpjo)
	the database connection string (into bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config) can now be configured to specify the SQLCE file location or use a standard SQL server (useful for a centralized database, with myrtille clustered). (thanks bigpjo)

	resynced FreeRDP with master repository; FreeRDP 2.0-RC2 milestone: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/8
	FreeRDP HOTFIX: connection using FQDN is broken (either direct connection or through a connection broker redirection), using target IP instead
	FreeRDP HOTFIX: fixed client IP resolution when using an ipv6 connection
	updated the connection tooltip (ipv6 addresses require brackets, i.e. [::1])
	changed the right-click button mechanism to a toggle

2017-12-09 Version 1.6.1 (stable)
	enabled fonts smoothing
	modified disconnect button tooltip
	removed pipes messages size limitation
	pipes are no longer buffered

2017-11-14 Version 1.6.0 (stable)

	ignore certificate warning (when using NLA); may happen, for example, with a self-signed certificate (not trusted) or if the server joined a domain after the certificate was issued (name mismatch). more details here: http://www.vkernel.ro/blog/configuring-certificates-in-2012r2-remote-desktop-services-rds (required with the latest FreeRDP build)
	connection settings (including user credentials) are no longer passed to FreeRDP through command line; using pipe communication instead (thanks Paul)
	auto-connect / start program from url now doesn't require the "&program=" parameter (access to the desktop if missing or empty) (thanks noetius)
	custom mouse cursors are now supported with IE (thanks Thijs)
	added a "Right-Click" button (into the toolbar) to simulate a right-click action on devices which don't have a mouse (or a right button) (thanks Scott)
	performance tweak: now using PNG encoding by default (instead of mixed PNG/JPEG); drawback is it uses more bandwidth with graphic applications (use AUTO encoding in this case; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled mouse move sampling; drawback is it may lower the responsiveness with graphical applications (enable the sampling in this case; 10% for example; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled blob support (using base64 instead); blob is a newer javascript construct but is cached on disk whereas base64 data is cached in memory (faster); config.js

	increased max file upload/download size up to 1GB (tweakable into Myrtille.Web and Myrtille.Services configs, if needed)

	the remote session log is now configurable into Myrtille.Services config (disabled by default)
	the remote session display is now responsive (scale to browser size, disabled by default)
